# Artificial-Intelligence-AI-Catalog
There are so many AI tools these days that I have begun cataloguing them.

The catalog is organized based on extended taxonomy from the Federal Enterprise Architecture Framework
because after having done an extensive survey of taxonomies, I found that the FEAF had the best hierarchy.
Unfortunately, the FEAF has not been updated in over a decade, so many new categories have needed to have
been added.  Some probably need further categorization, for instance tools that create or improve on prose
are included in the Word Processing category.  While these tools do process words, perhaps a new category
indicating that the tool is generating the text is required.  I haven't yet done that because I am trying 
to avoid creating a deeper taxonomy.  We shall see.

I am providing this in Excel format because I find it's sort capabilities make the catalog more useful.
